# DictionaryApi-CS
C# API for interacting with Dexterity dictionaries. Targets .NET 5.0 by default, but I plan to also add support for more versions eventually. Also includes DictDumper, a tool that I use during development to see what the library is actually reading out of the file.

# Building
**Requires Visual Studio 2019 or newer.** Visual Studio 2022 should work but I haven't tested it.

Just open up the solution and press play.

*TODO: Add command line build instructions*

# Functionality

Don't expect 100% compatibility with Dexterity just yet. [Check this project for more information about functionality.](https://github.com/OpenDexterity/DictionaryApi-CS/projects/1)
